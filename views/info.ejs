      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <strong>GlucoInsight</strong> is an AI-powered tool designed to help
        individuals estimate their potential risk of developing type 2 diabetes
        based on a few basic lifestyle and health factors.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base text-gray-700">
        This project was developed as part of a Data Science Masterâ€™s
        dissertation. It uses real data from the 2023 BRFSS survey and applies
        machine learning models to generate personalised risk assessments.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mt-8">How it works</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Users fill out a short form about age, sex, weight, height, activity,
          general health, and insurance status.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app uses a trained model (HistGradientBoosting) to estimate the
          risk of type 2 diabetes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The result is shown as a percentage along with a risk level and
          suggested resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
